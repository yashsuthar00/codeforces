# Place your input and output testcases here.
# For each problem, add files like:
#   236A.in   (input for 236A.cpp/236A.java)
#   236A.out  (expected output, optional)
#
# The workflow will automatically run each solution with its corresponding input file.
# Example structure:
#   testcases/236A.in
#   testcases/236A.out
#   testcases/1A.in
#   testcases/1A.out
